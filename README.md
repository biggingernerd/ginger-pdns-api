Awesome Ginger PowerDNS Rest API


How To Install
--------------

- 1: Put in apache, rewrite all to /index.php
- 2: Put database credentials to powerdns database in config/database.php (copy file config/database.php.dist)
- 3: Go to resource by getting /domain (currently only one working).
- 4: Receive the (not so) awesome JSON
- 5: Have a beer and wait until more functionality is written (though it would be even more awesome when you'd have a beer and write more functionality)


YEAH!
